There are three balustrades and the Bird Spire; with these balustrades referring to the Common Koel. All thirteen balustrades have been designed from a standard; simple design. The abstract references to the birds offered the opportunity to add variations to the design. The bird spire; also designed by A - Teem creates a more literal representation of all three birds and is therefore intended as an interpretive signpost to the balustrades.",

OUR DAY OUT is an ongoing collaboration between the two artists. The first stages of OUR DAY OUT were supported by the Australia Council Arts and Craft Strategy; and through a studio residency at Spike Island in Bristol; UK. OUR DAY OUT yourspace was supported by Artspace; Sydney through a studio residency and exhibition.  OUR DAY OUT is an installation/sculpture project which engages the audience in a semi-participatory excursion through the sculptural and emotional terrain of armchair tourism. It’s a real day out; a day sightseeing; a tourist attraction.  OUR DAY OUT has been evolving in a number of formats since it’s launch in 2004. The most recent format of the collaboration; OUR DAY OUT yourspace; was shown at Artspace Sydney; Australia following a 5 week studio residency in the Artspace studios. OUR DAY OUT City Limits was the culmination of a 3 month studio residency at Spike Island in Bristol; UK during the summer of 2005 and OUR DAY OUT Daytripper was shown in Brisbane; Australia in 2006.  James and Eleanor are interested in ideas; not conclusions. Individually; James makes works which investigate temporary living accommodation and containment. Eleanor explores landscape through intervention and dislocation. The strong links between their practices propelled them to collaborate on a largescale and ongoing project which could not have been realised alone. It’s a collaborative process; a daytrip for two.",

        "Brief_Description": "Krista Berga was born in Auckland NZ she now lives and works in Brisbane; her practice extends across sculpture; drawing and text and is revealed through exhibitions; installations and projections.   Berga's works in form and content are acts of transgression and transformation; she explores human metamorphosis the act of bodies reckoning in time and space.   Krista Berga’s text based works reveal the potency of words. Like textual sculpture; each word is carefully selected and gently moulded to generate a reaction in the viewer. ‘Milky Way’ explores themes of repetition and reduplication; revealing the uncertainty but also routine nature of existence.   From Artworkers.org  ...to the streets is a curated program of eight; off-site projects located around the Brisbane CBD and South Brisbane. The inception of this exhibition came from a desire to connect artists to the communities in which they work while promoting the depth of artistic talent in Australia.  With this as a starting point; the idea became a reality through a synthesis of objectives between the Arc Biennial and the Brisbane City Council's 10;000 Steps Program. Scheduled as a 'Walktober' event; this program of site specific performances; installations; video and design based art; seeks to challenge and engage; either as a one off experience or as a body of work connected by a walking trail between the various sites. The walking trail featured as part of the 2007 Arc Biennial Program during October 2007.   ALL INFORMATION CARE OF ARC BIENNIAL & ARTWORKERS",

Banners 1 & 4 Gateway Design show a Rufous Fantail eye view of Toowong; the gateway sculpture representing the sun; the sky and a checker board effect and black and white stripes forming overlapping imagery of the busy downtown precinct - signage; patchwork of business and cultural pursuits; the railway and street markings. Banners 2 & 5 Three Towers Design focuses on the recognisable open form of the top of the Gateway Sculpture (Tower 1); the blue Toowong Tower (Tower 2); the Bird Spire showing fig leaves from the sculpture (Tower 3). The triangle running across the design is derived from the idea of the Hearing Clinic - a mouth or trumpet at the left magnifying to the red spiral in the right panel taking its form from the cochlea. The spiral is also a symbol for a meeting place; now as a busy urban centre as well as in the Aboriginal culture pre European settlement. The small tiles of colour on the blue tower have their origin in the mosaic on downtown surfaces; the repetition of grids and squares to be found all over Toowong in windows tile; signage; architectural details etc. The black and white stripes bring in the contrasting graphics of street markings. Banners 3 & 6 Underneath the Arches Design focuses on the triple arched windows of the Royal Exchange Hotel; the gothic arches of the windows and architectural detail on the facade of St Thomas Church. The strong diagonal line through the two panels follows the roof line of the Church. The natural arch formed by the palm fronds in Mt Coot-tha Gardens. The Gateway Sculpture reflected in the Royal Exchange Hotel windows; suggesting that it can be seen from all over Toowong and is an icon for Toowong. The green triangle of grass at the front of St Thomas Church. Black and white graphics of a busy urban centre.",

From a distance; the mural appears as a large expanse of sky between two sloping planes; the Brisbane River and Mt Coot- tha. The middle section of the mural; representing the sky; has a number of images from Toowong drilled into the panels. At night; the drilled images are lit when motion sensors and solar powered lights located behind the mural panel are activated. A pedestrian walking past the mural panel activates each motion sensor and in turn; each .light which then shines through the drilled image for three seconds. This therefore creates a series of lit images at the same rate as the person walking past the mural.",

The mosaic; which shows the history of Chermside from pre-settlement to today; took 12 weeks of full-time work to make. The hands that run along the mosaic wall are the hands of the children from the Craigslea Primary School and the mural was painted by kids at Craigslea High School. Importantly also; with the help of our artist Kate; this project was built by long-term unemployed people in Brisbane. So you can see it’s a real community effort to come together for the Chermside Community Hub project.",

        "Brief_Description": "The William Jolly Bridge creative lighting project is using the iconic bridge to deliver a visual centrepiece for the city. The light projection is a permanent gift to Brisbane and will be lit for important cultural events and celebrations.  The first creative projections featured a series of images by artist Ian de Gruchy. The bridge was lit until early December 2009 with images associated with the local area; Brisbane's history and the bridge itself. Themes included:  Signatures and Petitions (1859) The bridge is gloved in the signatures of Brisbane residents who supported the petitions signed in 1859 which resulted in Brisbane being formally declared a local municipality on September 6; 1859. Under the terms of the New South Wales Municipalities Act of 1858; residents were required to submit a petition with at least 50 residents’ signatures. This first occurred in late December 1858 when a petition of 181 signatures was sent to New South Wales. However in March 1859; a second petition containing 240 signatures was submitted; objecting to the separation. A heated public meeting took place shortly after and in April and third and final petition was drawn and signed by 420 Brisbane residents; supporting Queensland’s separation.  Brisbane's Flag Brisbane’s flag features gold Caducei; gold Stafford Knots; white stars and wavy lines on a blue background. The Caduceus is the symbol of commerce and peace; and is the emblem depicted for Hermes in his capacity as God and Protector of Commerce. The Stafford Knot is the badge of the 38th Foot (Staffordshire Regiment) in which Sir Thomas Brisbane first entered the British Army as an Ensign in 1789. The stars indicate Brisbane’s achievements in the field of astronomy and the wavy lines represent the heavens and parting nebula or clouds.   Lord Mayor's Regalia (including ceremonial chain) For public events and formal occasions the Lord Mayor wears the traditional decorations and insignia of the office. This includes a ceremonial chain which features in this projection.  Meccano The metal ‘skeleton’ of the bridge under the concrete outer closely resembles a meccano set. From 1926-1932; prominent Brisbane civil engineer Harding Frew was commissioned by Brisbane City Council as Bridge Engineer for the design of the Grey Street (later renamed William Jolly) Bridge. Frew designed the bridge with a series of bow-string steel sections built using a Swiss system of concretesprayed steel (gunite). Frew was originally criticised for his design of the bridge - using some new and innovative practices for spraying the arch concrete over the steel.  Wattle and Red Poinsettia Red Poinsettia During his six-year term in office; William Jolly and the Brisbane horticultural societies decided that the city needed a floral emblem. After a conference of all the societies and a public survey in the Brisbane media; the red Poinsettia; indigenous to Mexico; was selected as Brisbane’s floral emblem. Wattles As Australia’s national floral emblem; the wattle is an image synonymous with Australia Day. The wattle images used for this projection were taken from flags displayed in Brisbane City  Lilla Watson; Soft Night Falling (2005) Derived from a previous collaboration; Soft Night Falling traced the layers of sound and silence; light and shadow that play upon each other at Dammerung; the transitional time when it is neither day nor night. To produce the original image; artist Lilla Watson burned holes through a top layer of paper giving entrance to the underlying layers of colour. Recalling her maternal grandmother’s Gangulu country in Central Queensland; Watson’s work is a rumination on the sights and sounds of nature; as ‘the last vestiges of daylight are engulfed by the shadows of darkness ... the coming of night; descending as a soft; dark blanket ... [the marks] contain the song cycles of the night-time creatures; and their sounds and movement; the song of trees and grasses and the brush of wings in the night.’Artist; educator and activist; Lilla Watson is a Murri woman who identifies strongly with her Mother's Gangulu country. Since moving to Brisbane in the late 1960's; she and other members of her family have become well known through their involvement in the Indigenous community. Watson worked at the University of Queensland for 10 years; the last six as lecturer in Aboriginal Welfare Studies.  Pixels and Diagonals Pixels (three projections) Pixels or the tiny dots of light that are the basic units from which digital images are composed; are utilised by de Gruchy as a way of deconstructing the creative and technical processes of photography and projection. Diagonals (two projections) This projection references the essential purpose of the bridge: to safely guide traffic movement and stasis. Typically; such markings serve as a psychological barrier and signify the delineation of traffic paths and its lateral clearance from hazards.",

        "Brief_Description": "The proposal for this iconic artwork lies with the image of water. The image of moving water will attract attention to the building and act as energetic refreshment in times when water is becoming more precious. The play of light on water is one of the most mesmerizing and fascinating images. The method of arriving at this image is very unusual and is obtained by placing large sheets of photographic film ( 60 x 100cm) under water. This photosensitive process captures the patterns of water and light in high quality information. The photogram is a nineteenth century photographic process that takes an impression from three dimensional reality through the variance of shadows. By taking this method and applying it to contemporary technologies like large sheets of film and high quality scanning technology I aim to present a new way of representing reality and hopefully contribute to our shifting understanding of the world around us. The swimming pool glass podium wall is the ideal architectural form to utilize this image. The image of water does not quote from; or reference the historic building to its side; but creates a modern contrast that enhances and celebrates difference in material and form . The window will be abstract and semi translucent like water but like the image of water it will change from many viewpoints. The energy of the image will activate the spaces around it. From close up; the viewer may study the infinite geography of the watery material but from a distance; broader systems and structures as a whole will emerge in visibility. From the street; the image of water will act as a landmark and a strong iconographic reference to the “River City’”.",

The birds and nests in the design expand in scale from the ground to the top of the Spire. The Bird Spire was also constructed on an 85 Degree angle leaning towards Sherwood Rd; in response to the direction the tree has grown over time. The small arcs crossing to the centre of the Bird Spire are suggestive of the short darting flights taken by the birds to feed on local fruits. Because of the literal representation of the birds; the Bird Spire is also an interpretive signpost to the balustrades in the centre; which provide abstract representations of the birds in their designs.",

        "Brief_Description": "For more than 18 years; Brisbane design studio Inkahoots has built a practice based around 'Direct Design Action' in social; cultural and political realms. Their installation situates participants within an interactive voting system. Examining a range of provocative topics and ideas; visitors are encouraged to get involved. Presented with the choice between two opposing ideas or words; you can select your preferred option by moving under sensors installed above the GPO walkway. Your 'vote' will then register on the archway as animated projections.  Inkahoots History Inkahoots  Inkahoots was formed out of a strong political and social protest movement in Brisbane in the 1980’s. In 1989 the Tenants Union of Queensland started a community poster project to address accommodation issues. The posters were based on the perspectives and experiences of specific groups of tenants namely women; Aboriginal people; young people; people with disabilities; community housing co-ops; ethnic communities and other disadvantaged groups. The project brought together a group of artists with similar social; political and artistic motivations of these artists three of whom developed the idea to form a collective.  The collective would become Inkahoots and the artists were Robyn McDonald; Chris Stannard and Geoff Heller. Shortly afterwards two more artists joined the group; Suzi Blackwell and Dee Martin. In 1989 the new studio began working on a number of poster projects for a wide variety of groups. Poster were printed with the organisers of the Labour Day parade; Lesbian and Gay Pride Week celebrations; Reclaim the Night and Access Arts workshops for people with disabilities.   In 1991 the Regional Galleries Association of Queensland toured 50 artworks from the first two years of Inkahoot’s work. The content of a number of the posters proved highly controversial but acted as an inspiration for similar artists’ initiatives in regional areas across Queensland. In 1994 Brisbane City Council; toughened its policies on Postering on council property forcing Inkahoots to look at new locations and spaces to exhibit their works. At this time a new young designer Jason Grant joined Inkahoots; and as a formally trained graphic designers was able to expand the both the visual vocabulary and technical parameters of the works being produced.  One of the first major exhibitions after the council’s decision to toughen its prosecution of street postering was held ironically by Brisbane City Council. The exhibition frank depiction of sexuality caused a public outcry; and forced a compromise between council and the collective. The compromise could be perceived as a direct outcome of forcing political and social protest off the streets and into sanctioned spaces; where content control is an ever present issue.  This compromise set the tone for future works by Inkahoots and a decision was made to seek no further government funding for projects. Inkahoots also dissolved as a company choosing instead to become a partnership between Robyn McDonald and Jason Grant; this inception of the partnership still operates today. In 1998 Inkahoots studio in Westend was struck by a serial arsonist and all of the works and archived materials were destroyed when the building was gutted. Incredibly the company survived and continues to thrive today; whilst adhering to its original social; political and ethical concerns.  All information taken from “Where did I come from? The History of Inkahoots” written by Chris Stannard 2000 from http://www.inkahoots.com.au/  ",

When six years old his parents removed to Bowen where he attended the local state school. In 1873 he competed for a scholarship of the annual value Of £50; and was top of the list for all Queensland. Going on to Brisbane Grammar School for some years; he sat for the matriculation examination in Melbourne in 1878; and won the scholarship for history; geography; English and French. He began the course for the degree of LL.B. and at the end of his first year was awarded the exhibition for Greek; Latin and logic. He graduated LL.B. in 1884; returned to Brisbane; and after reading for a year with P. Real (afterwards a judge of the supreme court of Queensland) began to practise as a barrister. He was quickly successful and within a few years was making a large income. In August 1890 Sir Samuel Griffith (q.v.) offered him the portfolio of solicitor-general in his ministry with a seat in the upper house. Byrnes accepted but in 1893 stood for the legislative assembly and was elected for Cairns. He was attorney-general in the next ministry under Sir Thomas McIlwraith (q.v.); and held the same position in the succeeding Nelson ministry. When Nelson became president of the legislative council early in 1898; though Byrnes was easily the youngest man in the ministry; there was a general feeling that he should be the next premier. He took office in April 1898 and almost at once made a tour of the colony; so that he might become familiar with the general conditions. Shortly after the opening of parliament; though apparently in robust health; he took ill and died of pneumonia at Brisbane on 27 September 1898.

Graffiti removal was becoming very costly. To tackle the problem; a community arts project was developed and managed by Brisbane City Council’s Community Development Section; in consultation with local Councillor; Geraldine Knapp. As the graffitists were thought to be young people from the area; the project was designed to develop a sense of ownership of the artwork; which would make further graffiti less likely. The Gap Secondary School was approached to help with the initiative and they agreed for a Year 10 art class to be involved.",

        "Brief_Description": "Situated on the western wall of Anzac Square. A sculptured panel of infantry and horse drawn guns; it was erected by the women of Queensland in memory of 'all who lost their lives through the Great War 1914-18'. The idea of a women's contribution to the State War Memorial originated with the Brisbane Women's Club; which launched an appeal to women and women's organisations throughout Queensland. In late 1929 the so formed Queensland Women's War Memorial Committee awarded the commission to Daphne Mayo and decided that the memorial would be to all the State's war dead; not only to servicewomen. The stone carving was carried out from August 1931 to February 1932; with the assistance of George Harvey; elder son of well known local craftsman; L J Harvey. The bronze casting of the fountain was done by A Martin of New Farm; Brisbane. The memorial was unveiled by Lady Goodwin; wife of the then Governor of Queensland; on 24 March 1932. The proposed cost was to be 1;000 pounds but the appeal target was not reached until May that year when the sculptor was asked to add an unveiling inscription to the memorial. The Brisbane Women's Club continues to lay a wreath at the memorial on Anzac Day. The memorial comprises a bas relief panel of a military procession; carved in the Helidon sandstone blocks of the Ann Street wall. Above the panel is a bronze laurel wreath surrounded by commemorative lettering. Below; words from John Arkwright's hymn; O Valiant Hearts; are cut into the stone and also an unveiling inscription. The panel is protected by an ornamental iron railing set in the centre of which is a drinking fountain symbolic of renewed life. Its circular bronze urn is supported by four upturned dolphins; a pagan symbol of salvation. (Register of the National Estate http://www.deh.gov.au/ sighted 1/06/2006)",

        "Brief_Description": "The suspended sculpture is about freshwater len's; which is a body of fresh water that pools beneath coral atolls and sand islands; such as Queensland’s Heron Island and Stradbroke Island. The fresh water floats atop the salty seawater; its weight pushing out into a lens shape. Watson describes these as “hidden; fragile; precious jewels; sustaining the environment and all life forms.”  The theme of the site is the role of water in the community; rainwater from the Turbot Street overpass is harvested; fed into a water tank; and used to nourish the gardens of the public space below. The water tank is housed by a weathered steel screen which features patterns the artist developed to represent the flow of water from nearby Spring Hill.  from the UAP site http://uapmarker.com.au/2010/03/23/freshwater-lens-judy-watson/",

Controversy at the time was levelled because of the addition of the names of all the Aldermen of the day but not Mooney's; and the gothic lettering that was held to be difficult to read.
